# Employee Retention Analysis & Attrition Prediction

## 💡 Executive Summary

This project analyzes a dataset of **1,470 employees** to identify the root causes of employee turnover (attrition). By leveraging **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Random Forest classification**, the study isolates key risk factors such as **Overtime**, **Monthly Income**, and **Job Role**.

The ultimate goal is to provide HR departments with data-driven insights and a predictive model to proactively address employee retention.

## 🔑 Key Findings

Our analysis uncovered several critical drivers of employee attrition:

* **Burnout is a Primary Driver:** Employees working overtime are significantly more likely to leave the organization.
* **Compensation Gaps:** There is a strong correlation between lower median income and higher attrition rates.
* **High-Risk Departments:** The **"Sales Representatives"** and **"Laboratory Technicians"** roles show the highest turnover rates.
* **Strategic Impact:** A predictive model was developed to identify at-risk employees, allowing HR to intervene proactively before an employee decides to leave.

## 🛠️ Methodology & Tools

This project was executed using Python and the following key techniques:

* **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling data.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions and correlations to understand relationships between variables.
* **Machine Learning:**
    * **Random Forest Classifier:** Used to build a predictive model for employee attrition and determine feature importance.
